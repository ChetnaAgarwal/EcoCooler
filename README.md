PROBLEM STATEMENT: Minimizing Costs in Energy Consumption of a Data Center
In this case study, the primary objective is to minimize energy consumption costs in the cooling and heating systems of a data center. Data centers, known for their high energy demands, rely heavily on cooling systems to maintain optimal operating temperatures for servers and equipment. Inspired by DeepMind's achievement in reducing Google's data center cooling costs by 40% using a Deep Q-Learning (DQN) AI model in 2016, this case study aims to replicate a similar approach.

Developed an AI model using Deep Q-Learning to optimize server temperature regulation, achieving 87% energy savings.
Designed environment simulation methods for real-time AI action updates, current state retrieval, and reward calculation.
Built neural network architecture with fully connected input, hidden, and output layers; optimized with Mean Squared Error loss and Adam optimizer.
Implemented Experience Replay in DQN model to enhance learning efficiency with batch inputs and targets.
Trained AI through Deep Q-Learning with exploration-exploitation strategy, achieving optimal cooling/heating predictions with minimal energy use.
